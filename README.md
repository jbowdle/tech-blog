# Tech Blog

## Description
This is a tech blog that allows users to create accounts, make posts, and comment on other user's posts. It utilizes Sequelize and MYSQL to create a database so that users, posts, and comments are persistent. User sessions are created with Express Session and Connect Session Sequelize.

## Usage
Navigate to the [deployed site](https://boiling-badlands-68039.herokuapp.com/). It will open to the homepage where all posts can be viewed. By clicking on a post, you can see all comments that were left. Click login to create an account. Once an account is created, users can use the dashboard to view all of their posts and create their own posts. The user can also leave comments on posts.
